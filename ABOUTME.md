I'm Sean Coleman. I created and founded both [OrangeSlyce](http://orangeslyce.com) and [Blogic](http://blogic.com). OrangeSlyce failed because we failed to make something people want. Blogic was [acquired](http://www.bizjournals.com/phoenix/blog/business/2012/01/jobingcom-buys-az-disruptors-company.html?page=all) by Jobing.com in 2011.

I like to build what the world hasn't seen and inspire others to do the same. 

I teach a Design & Entrepreneurship course at Arizona State University.
